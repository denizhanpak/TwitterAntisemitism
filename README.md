# TwitterAntisemitism

This is a github repository for all code and scripts associated with the Antisemitism on Twitter detection project with Guenther Jikeli at Indiana University.

Pre-requisites to run the following files:

1) Python 3 - It is important to have the updated version of Python especially for file read and write operations
2) Lang Detect - In order to filter the English/Non-English tweets, we have used the langdetect package. This needs to be installed on the instance where you wish to run the script
The syntax should be something similar to:
### python3 -m pip install langdetect
